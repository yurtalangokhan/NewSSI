"""Shared Playwright-based fetching helpers.

Centralizes the browser-launch tuning and bot-detection-aware navigation
logic that was originally embedded in `onyx.connectors.web.connector`.

Two consumers:
- `WebConnector` (long-lived `BrowserContext` reused across many pages
  in a single crawl) uses `start_playwright()` directly.
- `OnyxWebCrawler` (lazy fallback when its `requests`-based fetch hits
  a Cloudflare/bot challenge) uses `fetch_rendered_html()` to do a
  one-shot navigation per URL.
